# Wasif Zulkernine ECE444Lab1 
Welcome my Lab 1 Repo!
## Activity 5 Screenshots and Commentary
1. Switched branches to rebase after comitting c3 and c4 and issued git rebase to get c1 and c2 after c4 in the git logs 
2. Faced merge error, opened vscode and resolved the errors with: 'code .' 
3. After resolving conflicts, did 'git add .' and then 'git rebase --continue' to move forward with rebasing
4. git status shows all is well at the end of the procedure 

At this point, logs reflect c1 and c2 appearing after c3 and c4 on the rebase branch. Normally, we could now switch branches to develop and merge/rebase with the rebase (feature) branch to finally insert the new code back into the develop branch, as we know there are no errors/conflicts with the main code base. I haven't done so as not asked for by the requirements.
